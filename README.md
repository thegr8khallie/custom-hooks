## Usage

In order to use these hooks, just follow the link to the particular hook that you are looking for and copy the code to the hooks folder on your local machine or to the component that you'd like to use it in. No need to install any Node modules. However, for hooks like the `useAxios` hook that build on a particular node package, it's important to install that package first before using that hook in your project.
